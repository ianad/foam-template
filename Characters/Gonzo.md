# Gonzagreus Gellhorn Haskal d'Sivis
![[Gonzo.png]]
> *but my friends call me Gonzo!*

## Gonzo

typically describes the writing of **Hunter S. Thompson**:

> _**Gonzo journalism** describes an energetic, first-person, participatory writing style in which the author is a protagonist, drawing its power from a combination of social critique and self-satire. It involves an approach to accuracy that concerns the reporting of personal experiences and emotions, in contrast to traditional journalism, which favors a detached style and relies on facts or quotations that can be verified by third parties_

## Martha Gellhorn

was a famous war correspondent, married to Ernest Hemingway. The **Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism** is awarded for

> _the kind of reporting that distinguished Martha: in her own words '**the view from the ground**'. This is essentially a human story that penetrates the established version of events and illuminates an urgent issue buried by prevailing fashions of what makes news. We would expect the winner to tell an unpalatable truth, validated by powerful facts, that exposes establishment conduct and its propaganda, or 'official drivel', as Martha called it._

## Haskal d'Sivis
 
Gonzo's uncle is [[Harlus Haskal d'Sivis]], of [[Clan Haskal]], [[House Sivis]]

> **[[Harlus Haskal d'Sivis]]** is an unbound scroll of [[House Sivis]] and a member of the Ninth College, a group dedicated to perfecting the blending of language and magic.

# Backstory

I worked for the [[Korranberg Chronicle]] during the war. [[Zilargo]] was relatively unaffected domestically, but supported [[Breland]]. As part of this, the [[Korranberg Chronicle|Chronicle]] sent correspondents all around Khorvaire. Correspondents like me.

I spent a lot of time in safe areas, gathering everyday stories, but would have spent time at or near front lines to cover the ground there as well, seen action during or the aftermath of significant battles. Along with manuscripts, I sent back regular reports to either the [[Korranberg Chronicle]] or [[House Sivis]].

-   What were these reports for?
-   Does the [[Korranberg Chronicle|Chronicle]] have ties to [[The Trust]]?
    -   Did [[The Trust]] act on reports I sent? Did this get people hurt?
    -   If so, do I know this now? Do I suspect?
-   Was information from my reports and manuscripts passed on to the [[King's Dark Lanterns]] or used to support [[Breland]]'s war effort before it was published?

Was I in or near [[Cyre]] on the [[Day of Mourning]]? What did I see? Perhaps I covered refugee movements, Brelish resettlements, the formation of [[New Cyre]]?

I heard a song once during the war, to which I can't remember the lyrics. But the tune sticks with me. I still hum it sometimes. [[Poor Wayfaring Stranger]]

## Zil Schemes
-   I've acquired a _spellshard_ containing a vast amount of encrypted text. Where did I get it? Do I have any leads on the cipher?
-   I am sleeping with an important local politician's aide. They are providing me with information for a story. What story? Which politician?
