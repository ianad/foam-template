# Triumvirate

The ruling body of Zilargo, the Triumvirate was originally an oversight committee made to monitor the behaviour of students and patrons of the Library of Korranberg. The powers and duties of this council eventually expanded to cover the entire nation.

It is comprised of a three-member council elected from each of three major cities: Trolanport, Korranberg, Zalanberg. Each of the three cities has its own Council of Nine comprised of gnomes from wealthy families who are charged with dealing with local civic concerns. In theory the cities' representative to the Triumvirate is democratically selected from amongst the Council of Nine's members.In practice, the process is anything but democratic, as secret wars of words and blackmail determine power within each council.

[[The Trust]] reports directly to the Triumvirate. The Trust has a coordinator for each city who works with the local Council of Nine. It is a state secret that the Triumvirate possesses an impressive vault of information concerning political, military, and economic activities that rivals that of the Library of Korranberg, thanks to the work of the Trust.
